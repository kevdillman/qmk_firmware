## Option A: Build And Flash Firmware

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make keychron/v5/ansi:keychron
    make keychron/v5/ansi_encoder:keychron
    make keychron/v5/iso:keychron
    make keychron/v5/iso_encoder:keychron

Flashing example for this keyboard:

    make keychron/v5/ansi:keychron:flash
    make keychron/v5/ansi_encoder:keychron:flash
    make keychron/v5/iso:keychron:flash
    make keychron/v5/iso_encoder:keychron:flash

**Reset Key**: Hold down the key located at *K00*, commonly programmed as *Esc* while plugging in the keyboard.

## Option B: Use Keychron Launcher (no code required)

If you just want to remap keys, configure layers, or change lighting, you don't need to build firmware:

1. Open [Keychron Launcher](https://launcher.keychron.com/) in a Chromium-based browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, or Vivaldi
2. Connect your Keychron keyboard via USB
3. Remap keys, configure layers, and adjust lighting - changes apply instantly

Keychron Launcher works out of the box with no JSON import required, providing a simpler browser-based setup flow for supported boards. Safari and other non-Chromium browsers will not work with Keychron Launcher.
